/* ðŸ§  2. POLYMORPHISM â€“ Feature Requests from Client
Domain: Notification System

[Beginner]
Weâ€™re building notifications. Create Email and SMS types â€” both should have a send() method with different behavior.

[Easy]
Add a base Notification type. Both Email and SMS should inherit from it and override send().

[Intermediate]
I want to be able to keep all notification types in an array and loop through them, calling send() polymorphically.

[Advanced]
Add a new PushNotification type. Ensure it integrates seamlessly into the same system with its own send() logic.

[Expert]
Create a NotificationManager function that accepts a list of mixed notifications and sends each of them using their polymorphic send() method.
