/* ðŸ§  2. POLYMORPHISM â€“ Feature Requests from Client
Domain: Notification System

[Beginner]
Weâ€™re building notifications. Create Email and SMS types â€” both should have a send() method with different behavior.


 */

class Notification {
  constructor(recipient) {
    this.recipient = recipient;
  }
}

Notification.prototype.send = function () {
  throw new Error("send() method must be implemented in the subclass");
};

class Email extends Notification {
  constructor(recipient) {
    super(recipient);
  }

  send() {
    return `ðŸ“§ Sending Email to ${this.recipient}`;
  }
}

class SMS extends Notification {
  constructor(recipient) {
    super(recipient);
  }

  send() {
    return `ðŸ“± Sending SMS to ${this.recipient}`;
  }
}

function sendNotification(notificationObj) {
  console.log(notificationObj.send());
}

let Email1 = new Email("tridiplaymakar97@gmail.com");
let SMS1 = new SMS("+91 84799-83303");

sendNotification(Email1);
sendNotification(SMS1);

/*
[Easy]
Add a base Notification type. Both Email and SMS should inherit from it and override send().





[Intermediate]
I want to be able to keep all notification types in an array and loop through them, calling send() polymorphically.

[Advanced]
Add a new PushNotification type. Ensure it integrates seamlessly into the same system with its own send() logic.

[Expert]
Create a NotificationManager function that accepts a list of mixed notifications and sends each of them using their polymorphic send() method.
