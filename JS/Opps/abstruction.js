/*  ABSTRACTION â€“ Feature Requests from Client
Domain: Smart Home System

[Beginner]
Create a LightSwitch object. I should only be able to turn it on/off. Internals like circuit control must be hidden.

[Easy]
Add a Thermostat object with methods like setTemperature(), but the heating mechanism should remain abstracted.

[Intermediate]
Design a SecuritySystem object. I just need arm() and disarm() methods. The rest should be internal.

[Advanced]
Implement a SmartHomeController that abstracts control of multiple devices (Light, Fan, Thermostat). Provide a unified runScenario('night') method.

[Expert]
Expose an external API object that lets third-party apps interact only with high-level smart-home commands like lockDoors(), startCleaning(), hiding all internal class logic.
